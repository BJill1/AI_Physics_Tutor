## AI_Physics_Tutor
This project uses NLP to analyse student-written Physics answers and give feedback based on semantic similarity. It also gives clear and conceptual explanation of key Physics concepts for grade 8 (form 3 in Cameroon) to grade 12 (Upper sixth in Cameroon) students.

## Features
- Ask a user if they need help on the topic of the question.
- If the user types 'yes', it provides a clear and conceptual explanation
- If the user types 'no', it goes ahead to accept an answer from the user to the question
- Compares to model answers using sentence-transformers
- Gives feedback on correctness
